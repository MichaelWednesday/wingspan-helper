# Wingspan Helper

A small web app dedicated to the beautiful boardgame [Wingspan](https://stonemaiergames.com/games/wingspan/). It currently provides a digital scoresheet. A companion for the Automata for solo playing is planned.

:sparkles: You can add the app to your homescreen and use it offline if you want!

## Credits

This project was started by [greengiraffe](https://github.com/greengiraffe/wingspan-helper). Honestly, 99% of the work was done by him, kudos for the effort and making such a beautiful app! I am only making small changes to it, like adding more supported languages, improving assets, and other minor features for a more refined experience.

This is an independent open source project, it is not related to Stonemaier Games or the original boardgame Wingspan in any way.

The graphic of the scissor-tailed flycatcher used as the app icon and for the site header is based on the original artwork by [Natalia Rojas](https://www.nataliarojasart.com/).

The handwritten typeface used is Cardenio Modern by [Nils Cordes](http://nilscordes.com/).
